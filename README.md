Hello!

Welcome to the Blitz Analytics - Airline Analytics Capstone Project!

To Team:

Please work in your own branch to avoid conflicting or overwriting main!

To ALL: 

Before you begin we suggest you download any required Python Dependencies as well as the latest data from the Bureau of Transportation from the following link:

Alternatively, navigate to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Website -> Go to Aviation -> and click the D1B1 Data -> D1B1 Market Data   (Name may differ slightly)

This file is approximately 1.6 GB so please allocate this space in your files adequately. 

Also note that this project has not been finalized, so excuse our dust!

We hope you find this tool helpful!
